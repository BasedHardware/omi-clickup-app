# 🌍 Timezone Support - Date/Time Fix

## ❌ Problem Fixed

**Issue**: AI was adding dates from one year ago (using training data example dates)

**Root Cause**: AI wasn't receiving current date context and had no timezone awareness

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Current Date Context for AI**

The AI now receives the **actual current date and time** before parsing:

```
IMPORTANT - CURRENT DATE/TIME CONTEXT:
Today is: Thursday, October 30, 2025 at 02:45 PM
Current date: 2025-10-30
Timezone: America/Los_Angeles
```

This ensures the AI calculates dates correctly:
- "tomorrow" → October 31, 2025 (not a date from training data)
- "in 2 hours" → October 30, 2025 at 4:45 PM
- "next Friday" → November 7, 2025

### 2. **Timezone Settings in UI**

Users can now select their timezone from the settings page:

**Available Timezones:**
- 🇺🇸 Eastern (New York)
- 🇺🇸 Central (Chicago)
- 🇺🇸 Mountain (Denver)
- 🇺🇸 Pacific (Los Angeles) ← **Default**
- 🇬🇧 London (GMT/BST)
- 🇪🇺 Paris (CET/CEST)
- 🇩🇪 Berlin (CET/CEST)
- 🇯🇵 Tokyo (JST)
- 🇨🇳 Shanghai (CST)
- 🇦🇪 Dubai (GST)
- 🇮🇳 India (IST)
- 🇦🇺 Sydney (AEDT/AEST)
- 🌐 UTC (Universal)

### 3. **Timezone-Aware Date Conversion**

When converting ISO dates to Unix timestamps for ClickUp:
- Uses the user's selected timezone
- Properly handles daylight saving time
- Converts to UTC for ClickUp API

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Example: "Create task by tomorrow 5pm"

**User in Pacific Time (PST):**
1. User says: "Create ClickUp task fix bug by tomorrow 5pm"
2. AI receives: "Today is Thursday, October 30, 2025 at 2:45 PM (America/Los_Angeles)"
3. AI calculates: "tomorrow 5pm" = "2025-10-31T17:00:00"
4. System converts: 2025-10-31 5pm PST → Unix timestamp (with PST timezone)
5. ClickUp receives: Correct due date in user's timezone! ✅

**User in India (IST):**
1. Same voice command
2. AI receives: "Today is Friday, October 31, 2025 at 3:15 AM (Asia/Kolkata)"
3. AI calculates: "tomorrow 5pm" = "2025-11-01T17:00:00"
4. System converts: 2025-11-01 5pm IST → Unix timestamp (with IST timezone)
5. ClickUp receives: Correct due date in IST! ✅

## 🌍 Timezone Settings Location

**Access settings:**
1. Go to app homepage: `https://your-app-url/?uid=<your_uid>`
2. Scroll to **"🌍 Timezone Settings"** section
3. Select your timezone from dropdown
4. Click **"Save Timezone"**
5. Done! All future date/time parsing will use your timezone

## 📋 Example Commands with Dates

All these now work correctly with your timezone:

```
✅ "Create ClickUp task fix bug by tomorrow"
   → Due: Tomorrow at 11:59 PM in YOUR timezone

✅ "Add ClickUp task call client in 2 hours"
   → Due: Current time + 2 hours in YOUR timezone

✅ "Create ClickUp task meeting Friday at 3pm"
   → Due: This Friday at 3:00 PM in YOUR timezone

✅ "Add ClickUp task submit report by end of month"
   → Due: Last day of current month at 11:59 PM in YOUR timezone

✅ "Create ClickUp task review mockups next week"
   → Due: Calculated from current date in YOUR timezone
```

---

## 🔐 Stored Data

Your timezone preference is saved with your user data:

```json
{
  "uid": "your_uid",
  "access_token": "...",
  "team_name": "Your Workspace",
  "selected_list": "list_id",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"  ← Saved here
}
```

---

## ⚡ Benefits

- ✅ **Accurate dates** - No more dates from the past
- ✅ **User timezone** - Dates calculated in YOUR local time
- ✅ **Daylight saving** - Automatically handled
- ✅ **Global support** - 13 major timezones + UTC
- ✅ **Persistent** - Timezone saved with your account
- ✅ **Easy to change** - Update anytime from settings

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Fix

1. **Set your timezone** in settings (e.g., America/Los_Angeles)
2. **Try this command**: "Create ClickUp task test by tomorrow 3pm"
3. **Check the task** in ClickUp - should show tomorrow's date at 3pm
4. **Verify** the date is in the future, not the past!

### Debug Logs

When a task with due date is created, you'll see:

```
✅ Extracted - List: tasks, Task: 'Test', Priority: 3
   Due Date: '2025-10-31T15:00:00'
📅 Due date: 2025-10-31T15:00:00 (America/Los_Angeles) → 1730408400000
📤 Creating task: Test in list abc123
✅ Task created: xyz789
```

The timestamp shows the conversion was timezone-aware!
